# variables are containers for storing data
"""Creating Variables

Python has no command for declaring a variable.

A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it or initialize it.

Example"""

my_name = "joseph"  #assigning a string 'joseph' to variable named my_name

x = 57 # assigning an integer datatype

xyz = True

# variables can be changed 
# example

y = 4
y = 10

print(y)

# this will print 10 in terminal


# *********************************EXERCISE************************************************
# you can specify the datatype as shown below

name = str('joseph mbugua')
print(name)

# will print joseph mbugua

#  Python is case sensitive.That mean a = 5 is not the same as A =54

a= 5
A = 45

print(a) #will print 5 in the terminal

print(A)# will print 45 in terminal
