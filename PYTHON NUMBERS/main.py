#****************PYTHON NUMBERS***************
"""In python we have three numeric:

1,int
2,float
3.complex

"""

# EXAMPLES

x = 1    # int
y = 2.8  # float
z = 1j   # complex

"""
         INTEGERS
Int, or integer, is a whole number, positive or negative, without decimals.

"""

#EXAPLES INCLUDE

A =1
b=100000000000

#to verify the type of the variable, use keyword type
print(type(A))


"""      FLOAT
Float "float is a number, positive or negative, containing one or more decimals.

"""
# EXAMPLES INCLUDE

z = 1.03
x = 5.09388378363566373

print("")
print(type(z))# verify the type of the variables

# ******************COMPLEX***************

# Complex numbers are written with a "j" as the imaginary part:
x = 3J+5j
y = 53j
z = -57j

print(type(x))
print("")
print(type(y))
print("")
print(type(z))

# this will return the types as comples datatypes


# Type Conversion
# You can convert from one datatype  to another

# EXAMPLES

x = 14    # int
y = 2.832  # float
z = 14j   # complex

#convert from int to float:
c = float(x)

#convert from float to int:
u = int(y)

#convert from int to complex:
p = complex(x)

print(c)
print(u)
print(p)

print(type(c))
print(type(u))
print(type(p))


"""
Random Number
Python does not have a random() function to generate a random number.
However, it has a built-in module called random that can be used to generate random numbers:

For this purpose , you must Import the random module

see an example below
