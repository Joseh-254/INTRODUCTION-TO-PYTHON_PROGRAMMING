# # python formating is done to allow compactibility with other data types
# we can combine strings and numbers by using the format() method!

# The format() method takes the passed arguments, formats them, and places them in the string where the placeholders {} are:

#example
age = 36
name = "My name is John, and I am {} years old"
print(name.format(age))
